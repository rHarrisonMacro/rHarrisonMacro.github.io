We use a structural overlapping-generations model to quantify the effects of five exogenous forces that drive the global trend equilibrium real interest rate, Global R\*. We find that Global R\* rises from the mid-1950s to the mid-1970s, declining steadily thereafter. The decline is driven predominantly by slowing productivity growth and increasing longevity.'

(with Ambrogio Cesa-Bianchi and Rana Sajedi - October 2023 update)

This paper develops a structural model to study the global trend real interest rate, "Global R\*". We focus on five potential drivers: productivity growth, population growth, longevity, government debt, and the relative price of capital. We employ a recursive simulation method in which beliefs about long-run trends are updated gradually. The simulations are guided by estimates of the global trend component of each driver derived from a panel data set of 31 countries from 1950 to 2020. Global R\* rises until the mid-1970s before declining by around 3 percentage points. The decline is driven by slowing productivity growth and increasing longevity.
