excerpt: '

This paper studies optimal use of the central bank balance sheet in a simple New Keynesian model with portfolio frictions. Optimal quantitative easing (QE) entails large and rapid purchases of government debt when the short-term policy rate hits the lower bound. Optimal balance sheet reduction (quantitative tightening, QT) is more gradual. QT strategies similar to those pursued by the Federal Reserve and Bank of England can achieve similar welfare to optimal policy as long as the pace of QT is appropriately calibrated.'

This paper studies optimal monetary policy in a New Keynesian model with portfolio frictions
that create a role for the central bank balance sheet as a policy instrument. Central bank
purchases of long‑term government debt (‘quantitative easing’) reduce average portfolio
returns, thereby increasing aggregate demand and inflation. Optimal time‑consistent policy
prescribes large and rapid asset purchases when the policy rate hits the zero bound.
Optimal balance sheet reduction (‘quantitative tightening’) is more gradual. A central
bank that pursues a flexible inflation target can achieve similar welfare to optimal policy if
quantitative tightening is calibrated appropriately.
