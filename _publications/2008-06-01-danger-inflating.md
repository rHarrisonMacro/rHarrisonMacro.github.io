We discuss the cause and durability of the marked fall in the volatility

announced by the central bank. Agents switch between 
heuristics based on an imperfect assessment of how each has
performed in the past. Movements in the proportions of agents using each heuristic 
generate fluctuations in small-sample measures of economic
volatility. We find
that, relative to the rule that would be optimal under rational
expectations, a rule that responds to both productivity shocks
and inflation expectations better stabilizes the economy but
does not prevent agents from switching between heuristics.'

We use a monetary overlapping-generations model to discuss
the cause and durability of the marked fall in the volatility
of inflation in recent decades. In our model, agents have to
forecast inflation, and they do so using two “heuristics.” One
is based on lagged inflation, the other on an inflation target
announced by the central bank. Agents switch between those
heuristics based on an imperfect assessment of how each has
performed in the past. The way the economy propagates productivity
shocks into inflation depends on the proportion of
agents using each heuristic. Movements in these proportions
generate fluctuations in small-sample measures of economic
volatility. We use this simple model of heuristic switching to
contrast the performance of monetary policy rules. We find
that, relative to the rule that would be optimal under rational
expectations, a rule that responds to both productivity shocks
and inflation expectations better stabilizes the economy but
does not prevent agents from switching between heuristics.
Finally, we study the impact of introducing an explicit inflation
target, which can be used by agents as a simple heuristic,
into an economy that did not previously have one. Depending
on the heuristics agents have access to before the introduction
of the target, this can result in reduced inflation volatility.
